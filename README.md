Once i have made a couple other practice tickets from my users ken and karen i will now be trying to solving the ticket by logging back
in as my agents john and jane.i had to change jane admin because jane didnt have permission to view them,so i had to make her supreme admin as well.

Now i will Configure the tickets by setting their SEV level and assign them to agents jane or john.
